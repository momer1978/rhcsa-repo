


To practice for exam, I configured three servers. 
Make sure they are on the same subnet 
OR 
atleast have network connectivity among each other

Server1.example.com - installed httpd, hosted repos, configured nfs server and nfs share directories (This is not part of exam objectives but helps simulate the exam environment)
Client1.example.com - practice machine
Client2.example.com - practice machine


For repo question.
1. Create your account on developer.redhat.com
2. after creating an account you'll have username and password
3. Make sure server1.example.com is connected to internet


### On server1.example.com (non of the actions on server1 is among exam objectives)
-Using subscription manager register it with redhat network
subscription-manager register
username:
Password:
subscription-manager attach --auto

-Install httpd
dnf install httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl status httpd

-Mount RHEL8 dvd
-- attach RHEL8 dvd to this vm
mkdir /mnt/cdrom
mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
cd /var/www/html
cp -rf /mnt/cdrom/BaseOS .
cp -rf /mnt/cdrom/AppStream .

-Set the context if it is not already set 
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/BaseOS
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/AppStream
restorecon -Rv /var/www/html/BaseOS
restorecon -Rv /var/www/html/AppStream
 
-Open the firewall
firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

-Restart httpd 
systemctl stop httpd
systemctl start httpd

### On client1.example.com (This is one of the exam objective)
dnf config-manager --add-repo http://server1.example.com/BaseOS
dnf config-manager --add-repo http://server1.example.com/AppStream

cd /etc/yum.repo.d/

-- you'll see two files under this directory 
server1.example.com_AppStream.repo
server1.example.com_AppStream.repo

-- edit both files to include following line
gpgcheck=0

-- If the question ask to add gpgkey then edit the files to add the following 
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://server1.example.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
